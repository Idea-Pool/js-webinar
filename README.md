## Tasks

To solve the tasks of each module first you should read carefully both the documentation (i.e. `/** */`) and simple comments (i.e., `//`, `/* */`), but in short the following actions should be taken:

1. The solution code should be written between the comment lines which indicates it and the result should be assigned to the given variable:

    ```javascript
    // PLACE YOUR CODE BETWEEN THIS...
    resultVariable = 42;    
    // ...AND THIS COMMENT LINE!
    ```
    
1. In this module the Mocha test suites and test cases should be defined in `module-2/test/calc.spec.js`.

   The implementation of the suites and cases is not the main task in this module, but it can be done.
