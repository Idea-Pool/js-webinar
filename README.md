# js-webinar

Tasks of JS webinar.

## Requirements

* Git
* NodeJS 8 (6 is also supported)

## Setup

```
$> git clone https://github.com/szikszail/js-webinar.git
$> cd js-webinar
$> npm install
```

## Running tests

To run tests for each module, you can use the 

```
$> npm run test:module-N
```

where `N` is the number of modules, i.e. 1-5.

For example to run the test for the first module, use

```
$> npm run test:module-1
```

## Tasks

To solve the tasks of each module first you should read carefully both the documentation (i.e. `/** */`) and simple comments (i.e., `//`, `/* */`), but in short the following actions should be taken:

1. The solution code should be written between the comment lines which indicates it and the result should be assigned to the given variable:

    ```javascript
    // PLACE YOUR CODE BETWEEN THIS...
    resultVariable = 42;    
    // ...AND THIS COMMENT LINE!
    ```
    
1. In this module the Mocha test suites and test cases should be defined in `module-2/test/calc.spec.js`.

   The implementation of the suites and cases is not the main task in this module, but it can be done.
1. In this module the task is to create Element, Elements, Layout and HomePage classes according to what is written in the presentation.
