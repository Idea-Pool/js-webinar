/**
 * Create an Element class that represents an element of
 * the application, and
 * 
 * 1. It has a protractor locator (.locator),
 *    e.g. by.css("h1.title")
 * 2. It has a name (.name), e.g. "Document Title"
 * 3. It can have a parent Element, 
 *    which is the context of the element (.parent)
 * 4. It can have children Elements (.children)
 * 5. It has a method to retrieve the protractor element
 *    by the locator (.get([name])) in it's context
 *     - if it gets a name as parameter, it tries to find
 *       in it's children (recursively) the Element with
 *       the given name or throws an Erorr if it cannot
 *       find the element
 * 
 * Use Protractor API to retrieve element
 * @see {@link https://www.protractortest.org/#/api?view=ElementFinder}
